To start the application, you need to run both the backend and frontend servers.

### Step 1: Start the Backend

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:
   cd backend

2. Install the Python dependencies (if not already installed):
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   python main.py

   The backend will run at http://localhost:8000.

### Step 2: Start the Frontend

1. Open a NEW terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   cd frontend

2. Install the Node.js dependencies (if not already installed):
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

   The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.

### Configuration
You can configure the ports by editing the `app.properties` file in the root directory.

Default configuration:
BACKEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PORT=5173

After changing the ports in `app.properties`, restart both the backend and frontend servers.

### Note on Data Storage
The backend is currently configured to save data to: C:\Balaji\Career\KBASE\data.json
Ensure this directory exists or update `backend/main.py` to use a different path.
